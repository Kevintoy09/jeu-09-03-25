#    Profiles
#
#    You can extend section / key with a profile
#    For example, you want to deploy a demo version of your application without
#    HD content. You could first change the title to add "(demo)" in the name
#    and extend the excluded directories to remove the HD content.
#
#[app:demo]
#title = My Application (demo)
#
#[app:demo:android]

#    Then, invoke the command line with the "demo" profile:
#buildozer --profile demo android debug
#
#    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#    You can also specify "export_to_tar" to create a tarball instead of
#    a packaged application. The tarball will contain all the files
